**Worker Management System**

This is a prototype of the Worker Management system. 
This full-stack application, built using React.js, Next.js, Express.js, and MySQL, serves as a centralized platform for managing worker, trade, and training records across multiple teams within an organization.
Beyond just record-keeping, the system features automated alerts for upcoming and missed deadlines, ensuring that no important task or certification falls through the cracks. It also includes a powerful reporting module, enabling users to generate and download Excel reports filtered by department, trade, and alert typeâ€”making compliance and performance tracking seamless.
To enhance usability, the platform offers interactive graphs, as well as advanced filtering and sorting capabilities that provide an intuitive and engaging user experience. Whether you're managing large teams or tracking detailed training milestones, this application is designed to make complex data easy to explore and act upon.
